Exercise 1: Inventory Management System

Scenario: 
I am developing an inventory management system for a warehouse. Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial.

Steps:
1.	Understanding the Problem:
o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
             Data structures allow for efficient organization and storage of inventory data. This includes the ability to quickly access, update, or remove items.
Common data structures used for inventories include arrays, linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs. Each has its own advantages depending on the type of operations required.

2. Types of data structures suitable for this problem:

ArrayList: Provides dynamic arrays that can grow as needed. Good for situations where fast iteration and random access are required, but not ideal if frequent insertions or deletions are necessary at random positions.

HashMap: Offers average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. It is an excellent choice for managing a collection of products by unique identifiers (e.g., product ID).

LinkedList: Useful if the system frequently inserts and deletes elements, as these operations are faster compared to an ArrayList. However, access time is slower since it requires sequential access.

4. Analysis
Time Complexity Analysis:

Add Product: Using a HashMap, the average time complexity is O(1) due to the direct access capability provided by hashing.

Update Product: Also has an average time complexity of O(1), as it requires a lookup and then an update, both of which are O(1) operations in a HashMap.

Delete Product: The average time complexity is O(1) because removing an element from a HashMap requires a hash function calculation and deletion, both of which are O(1).

Optimizing Operations:

The operations are already optimized using a HashMap. To further enhance performance, ensure that the hash function used is efficient and reduces collisions, as high collision rates can degrade the performance to O(n).

If additional features are required, such as ordering or frequent inserts at random positions, other data structures like TreeMap or LinkedHashMap might be considered for their specific properties and optimizations.
